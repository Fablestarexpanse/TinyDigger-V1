# TinyDiggers — decisions and findings

Append-only log of choices that the code cannot explain by itself. Git records what changed;
this records why.

---

**NEXT:** Data model, generator and chunked renderer are done and green (44/44), and
`Assets/TinyDiggers/Scenes/TerrainSandbox.unity` shows the terrain in play mode. Nothing is in
flight. Next step: RTS camera (WASD / scroll / Q-E), click-to-dig/fill with a brush, and the
hovered-cell debug readout.

Run the suite with the menu item **TinyDiggers > Run EditMode Tests**; it prints a single
`TESTS PASS ...` / `TESTS FAIL ...` line to the console, with one line per failure.

## 2026-09-17 — Vertical Slice 0: terrain data model

Starting state: the repo was the bare Unity 6000.6.1f1 URP template, one commit, no gameplay
code. Nothing from earlier sessions existed to review.

### Terrain model

Captain of Industry style column stacks, not a voxel grid: a 2D grid where each cell holds an
ordered list of `(MaterialId, thickness)` layers, bottom to top, and the surface height is their
sum. No overhangs or tunnels are representable, which is the point — it keeps the mesh a
heightfield and the digging arithmetic one-dimensional.

### Decisions

- **Cells are 1x1 metres, so one unit of volume is one metre of thickness.** Every volume in the
  API is therefore directly a height, and no cell-area factor has to be threaded through digging,
  hauling or the debug readout later.
- **Bedrock is not diggable.** `MaterialDefinition.IsDiggable` is false for it, and `Remove`
  stops when it reaches a layer that is not diggable, reporting less than was asked for. The
  world gets a floor without the grid hardcoding a material id. Callers must therefore treat the
  volume they got back as the truth, not the volume they requested.
- **`Remove` reports into a caller-owned `Span<MaterialVolume>`**, with a `List<MaterialVolume>`
  overload for call sites where a span is awkward. Digging happens per cell per brush per frame,
  so the hot path must not allocate; the list overload fills from a `stackalloc` buffer and
  reuses the list's capacity.
- **`Remove` refuses to dig material it has no room to report.** If the destination span fills
  up, it stops rather than removing material that would then vanish from the world. Consecutive
  layers of the same material merge into one entry, so `MaxLayersPerCell` entries always suffice.
- **Digging leaves no slivers.** A layer within `1e-5` of being consumed is popped whole, so
  repeated digging cannot accumulate a stack of near-zero layers that eats the 8-layer budget.
- **Layers live in one flat `Layer[]` of `width * height * 8`**, alongside a `byte[]` of layer
  counts and a cached `float[]` of surface heights, rather than a list per cell. Mutation
  allocates nothing and a chunk rebuild walks contiguous memory — which matters at the 512x512
  target.
- **Surface height is recomputed from the layers on every mutation**, not tracked incrementally.
  Eight adds is nothing next to the mesh rebuild it triggers, and the cached height can never
  drift away from the layers it describes.
- **`Color32` lives on `MaterialDefinition`.** The data model stays free of MonoBehaviour and is
  unit-testable in EditMode, but it does reference `UnityEngine`. Chosen for convenience over a
  fully engine-free model, because the renderer wants a vertex colour and nothing else would
  own it.
- **Out-of-bounds access throws** rather than returning a default. Brush editing near the grid
  edge must clamp against `InBounds` itself; a silent zero would show up as a mysterious flat
  spot instead of a stack trace.
- **`SetColumn` exists for generation**, which would otherwise fire one `CellChanged` per layer
  per cell. It validates the whole column before writing any of it, so a bad layer cannot leave
  a cell half replaced.
- **`CellChanged` fires only on real mutations.** A no-op `Add`, or a `Remove` that bedrock
  refuses, raises nothing, so the renderer does not rebuild chunks that did not move.

### Tooling

`TinyDiggers/Run EditMode Tests` was added under `Assets/TinyDiggers/Editor` because the Unity
MCP bridge exposes no test-runner tool. It drives `TestRunnerApi` and writes the result to the
console, which the bridge *can* read, so test runs are verifiable from outside the editor.

## 2026-09-19 — Vertical Slice 0: chunked renderer and test terrain

### Renderer

`ChunkedMeshTerrainRenderer` is plain C# behind `ITerrainRenderer`; `TerrainView` is the only
MonoBehaviour, and it only wires the grid, generator and renderer together and calls `Rebuild`
from `LateUpdate`.

- **One mesh per 32x32 chunk; heights at cell corners, as the brief asked.** A corner's height
  is the average surface height of the up to four cells that touch it, so the surface is
  continuous without skirts.
- **Each cell gets its own four vertices** instead of sharing corners with its neighbours. That
  costs 4 verts per cell rather than ~1, but it is what lets each cell carry its own top-material
  colour and a flat per-quad normal. Shared vertices would blend colours across material
  boundaries and smooth away the low-poly look. 32x32x4 = 4096 verts per chunk, so the index
  buffer stays 16-bit; `MaxChunkSize` is 127 for the same reason.
- **Editing a cell dirties every chunk that holds one of its eight neighbours.** The cell sets
  the four corners around it, and those corners belong to its neighbours' quads too. Missing
  this would leave seams along chunk borders.
- **The index buffer is written once per chunk.** Topology depends only on the chunk's size,
  so a rebuild uploads positions, normals and colours only. Bounds are computed while building
  rather than by `RecalculateBounds`.
- **Rebuilding allocates nothing on the managed heap:** scratch vertex, normal, colour and
  corner arrays are sized for a full chunk and reused by every build.
- **Chunks are `HideFlags.DontSave`** so they can never end up serialised into the scene.
- **No colliders.** Clicking will pick against the grid's heights directly; 256 MeshColliders
  that rebake on every dig would be the expensive way to do it.

**Known consequence of corner averaging:** raising or lowering a single isolated cell moves
each of its corners by only a quarter of the change, so a one-cell dig reads as a shallow
dimple. Brush digging is unaffected in its interior, where every corner is surrounded by dug
cells. The grid holds the true heights and the readout will show them. If single-cell edits
need to look exact, the fix is per-cell flat tops with vertical walls, which is a renderer-only
change behind the same interface.

### Shader

`TinyDiggers/Terrain Vertex Color` is hand-written URP HLSL: main-light N·L plus spherical
harmonic ambient, vertex colour, no textures, no shadows. It converts the vertex colours from
sRGB to linear itself, because Unity passes vertex colours through unconverted and the project
renders in linear space; without that the palette washes out. It has a `DepthOnly` pass so the
terrain appears in the depth texture. Shader Graph was not used, because a hand-written shader
diffs and reviews as text.

### Generator

`TerrainGenerator` stays in the pure data assembly and is deterministic per seed. Columns are
bedrock 10 m, then granite in hill cores, rock, dirt, and a 0.3 m topsoil cap. The soil thins
from 2.5 m on the plains to 0.4 m on hilltops, so digging on a hill reaches rock within a click
or two.

The first tuning (hills 8–12 m high over 6–12% of the map) was invisible from RTS camera
height. It now uses 16–24 m over 4–7%, which reads clearly.

### Measured, 2026-09-19

- 512x512 cells, 256 chunks: generation 45 ms, initial meshing 52 ms.
- Scripted edit in play mode (a 10-cell-radius, 3 m pit on the highest peak plus a dirt mound
  40 cells south): the pit went through the soil into rock; 3 of 256 chunks rebuilt in 0.49 ms.
- Frame time over 2000 play-mode frames in the editor: median 1.83 ms (~547 fps), p95 2.30 ms.
  **This is on an RTX 4090, not the mid-range target**, so it proves there is headroom rather
  than proving the target. The load is 256 draw calls, ~0.5M triangles and ~1M vertices. The
  shader is SRP-Batcher compatible. A mid-range check is still owed.

### Tooling finding

The Unity MCP camera-capture tool only grabs the Scene View, so game-camera screenshots are
taken by rendering `Camera.main` into a RenderTexture from `Unity_RunCommand`. The
RunCommand compiler does not reference `System.dll`, so `System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch` is
unavailable there; use `Time.realtimeSinceStartupAsDouble` instead.
