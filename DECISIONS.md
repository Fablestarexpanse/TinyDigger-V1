# TinyDiggers — decisions and findings

Append-only log of choices that the code cannot explain by itself. Git records what changed;
this records why.

**NEXT:** `TerrainGrid` and its tests are done and green (28/28). Nothing is in flight. The next
step is the chunked mesh renderer behind `ITerrainRenderer`, which is waiting on Ronan's
approval of the API as built.

Run the suite with the menu item **TinyDiggers > Run EditMode Tests**; it prints a single
`TESTS PASS ...` / `TESTS FAIL ...` line to the console, with one line per failure.

## 2026-09-17 — Vertical Slice 0: terrain data model

Starting state: the repo was the bare Unity 6000.6.1f1 URP template, one commit, no gameplay
code. Nothing from earlier sessions existed to review.

### Terrain model

Captain of Industry style column stacks, not a voxel grid: a 2D grid where each cell holds an
ordered list of `(MaterialId, thickness)` layers, bottom to top, and the surface height is their
sum. No overhangs or tunnels are representable, which is the point — it keeps the mesh a
heightfield and the digging arithmetic one-dimensional.

### Decisions

- **Cells are 1x1 metres, so one unit of volume is one metre of thickness.** Every volume in the
  API is therefore directly a height, and no cell-area factor has to be threaded through digging,
  hauling or the debug readout later.
- **Bedrock is not diggable.** `MaterialDefinition.IsDiggable` is false for it, and `Remove`
  stops when it reaches a layer that is not diggable, reporting less than was asked for. The
  world gets a floor without the grid hardcoding a material id. Callers must therefore treat the
  volume they got back as the truth, not the volume they requested.
- **`Remove` reports into a caller-owned `Span<MaterialVolume>`**, with a `List<MaterialVolume>`
  overload for call sites where a span is awkward. Digging happens per cell per brush per frame,
  so the hot path must not allocate; the list overload fills from a `stackalloc` buffer and
  reuses the list's capacity.
- **`Remove` refuses to dig material it has no room to report.** If the destination span fills
  up, it stops rather than removing material that would then vanish from the world. Consecutive
  layers of the same material merge into one entry, so `MaxLayersPerCell` entries always suffice.
- **Digging leaves no slivers.** A layer within `1e-5` of being consumed is popped whole, so
  repeated digging cannot accumulate a stack of near-zero layers that eats the 8-layer budget.
- **Layers live in one flat `Layer[]` of `width * height * 8`**, alongside a `byte[]` of layer
  counts and a cached `float[]` of surface heights, rather than a list per cell. Mutation
  allocates nothing and a chunk rebuild walks contiguous memory — which matters at the 512x512
  target.
- **Surface height is recomputed from the layers on every mutation**, not tracked incrementally.
  Eight adds is nothing next to the mesh rebuild it triggers, and the cached height can never
  drift away from the layers it describes.
- **`Color32` lives on `MaterialDefinition`.** The data model stays free of MonoBehaviour and is
  unit-testable in EditMode, but it does reference `UnityEngine`. Chosen for convenience over a
  fully engine-free model, because the renderer wants a vertex colour and nothing else would
  own it.
- **Out-of-bounds access throws** rather than returning a default. Brush editing near the grid
  edge must clamp against `InBounds` itself; a silent zero would show up as a mysterious flat
  spot instead of a stack trace.
- **`SetColumn` exists for generation**, which would otherwise fire one `CellChanged` per layer
  per cell. It validates the whole column before writing any of it, so a bad layer cannot leave
  a cell half replaced.
- **`CellChanged` fires only on real mutations.** A no-op `Add`, or a `Remove` that bedrock
  refuses, raises nothing, so the renderer does not rebuild chunks that did not move.

### Tooling

`TinyDiggers/Run EditMode Tests` was added under `Assets/TinyDiggers/Editor` because the Unity
MCP bridge exposes no test-runner tool. It drives `TestRunnerApi` and writes the result to the
console, which the bridge *can* read, so test runs are verifiable from outside the editor.
